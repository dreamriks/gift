# these strings are for the form on the MetaMod module configuration page:

$LANGUAGE HANDLING=$language handling
ALL INCLUDED MODULES=All included modules
ALL USERS=All users
AUTO-ENABLE INCLUDED MODULES?=Auto-enable included modules?
AVAILABLE MODULES=Available modules
BROWSERS PREFERRED LANGUAGE=Browsers preferred language
COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF 2-LETTER COUNTRY ABBREVIATIONS WHICH WILL NOT SEE THIS MODULE AT ALL.=Comma-separated list of 2-letter country abbreviations which will not see this module at all.
COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF 2-LETTER COUNTRY ABBREVIATIONS WHICH WILL SEE THIS MODULE. ALL OTHER COUNTRIES WILL BE EXCLUDED.=Comma-separated list of 2-letter country abbreviations which will see this module. All other countries will be excluded.
COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF MODULES POSITIONS AND/OR IDS THAT WILL ALWAYS BE INCLUDED, SUBJECT TO DATE, LOGGED-IN-USER STATUS, GEOIP AND LANGUAGE CONDITIONS ABOVE. THESE MODULES WILL BE INCLUDED BEFORE ANY RETURNED FROM THE PHP CODE BELOW.=Comma-separated list of modules positions and/or ids that will always be included, subject to date, logged-in-user status, GeoIP and language conditions above. These modules will be included BEFORE any returned from the PHP code below.
COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF PREFERRED LANGUAGE CODES, LOWER CASE. IF 'MOST PREFERRED LANGUAGE FROM SUPPLIED LIST' IS SPECIFIED ABOVE, THEN $LANGUAGE WILL CONTAIN THE LANGUAGE FROM THIS LIST THAT APPEARS HIGHEST IN THE BROWSER'S PREFERRED LANGUAGE SETTINGS. E.G. A BROWSER MAY BE SET UP FOR AR,FR. IF YOU ONLY TEST FOR THE FIRST LANGUAGE IN THE LIST, BUT HAVE NO CONTENT TO DISPLAY FOR ARABIC (AR), YOU MIGHT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT YOUR FRENCH (FR) CONTENT. SO BY SPECIFYING A LIST OF THE LANGUAGES YOU DO CATER FOR HERE, METAMOD WILL RETURN THE ONE THAT RANKS HIGHEST FOR A PARTICULAR VISITOR. IF 'STRICT LANGUAGE COMPARISON' IS TURNED OFF, THEN SPECIFYING A MAJOR LANGUAGE HERE (E.G. FR) WILL MATCH ANY VARIANTS OF THAT IN THE USER'S BROWSER, SUCH AS FR-FR, FR-CH, FR-BE OR PLAIN FR. EXAMPLE: DE,FR-FR,FR-BE,CS=Comma-separated list of preferred language codes, lower case. If 'Most preferred language from supplied list' is specified above, then $language will contain the language from this list that appears highest in the browser's preferred language settings. E.g. a browser may be set up for ar,fr. If you only test for the first language in the list, but have no content to display for Arabic (ar), you might miss the opportunity to present your French (fr) content. So by specifying a list of the languages you do cater for here, MetaMod will return the one that ranks highest for a particular visitor. If 'Strict language comparison' is turned off, then specifying a major language here (e.g. fr) will match any variants of that in the user's browser, such as fr-fr, fr-ch, fr-be or plain fr. EXAMPLE: de,fr-fr,fr-be,cs

MM_ENABLED=Enabled

OCTOBER 2 2008 E.G. 11:15 E.G. 10:00PM=End date, time or both for the module to display anything at all. If you specify only a date (not time) then the module will be active up until the START of the specified day. So you might want to specify 1 day later so that it runs until midnight.

END DATE/TIME (FREEFORM)=End date/time (freeform)
EXCLUDE THESE COUNTRIES=Exclude these countries
FOR USE WITH 'MOST PREFERRED LANGUAGE FROM SUPPLIED LIST' ABOVE. IF TURNED OFF, THEN SPECIFYING A MAJOR LANGUAGE HERE (E.G. FR) WILL MATCH ANY VARIANTS OF THAT IN THE USER'S BROWSER, SUCH AS FR-FR, FR-CH, FR-BE OR PLAIN FR.=For use with 'Most preferred language from supplied list' above. If turned off, then specifying a major language here (e.g. fr) will match any variants of that in the user's browser, such as fr-fr, fr-ch, fr-be or plain fr.
GEOCITY (COMMERCIAL)=GeoCity (commercial)

CREATE SOME PHP CODE TO DETERMINE WHICH MODULE SHOULD BE USED. ONCE THE SCRIPT HAS DECIDED WHICH MODULE OR MODULES TO DISPLAY, RETURN THE MODULE ID OR MODULE POSITION NAME, A COMMA-SEPARATED LIST OF MODULE IDS (AND/OR MODULE POSITION NAMES) AS A STRING, OR AN ARRAY OF MODULE IDS AND/OR MODULE POSITION NAMES. FOR MORE HELP AND RECIPES, SEE THE METAMOD HOME PAGE. E.G.=Create some PHP code to determine which module should be used.
